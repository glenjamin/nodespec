KNOWN ISSUES
------------

If a test takes longer to run than the timeout, but is not stalled, and there
is an after block defined, the after block exec will remove the done function
causing the test to error when done is eventually called. This also applies to
an async before hook.

Potential fixes:
  * Make the test a callable instead of test.done
  * Copy values into a new context for each step and leave done() alone
