** New method of detecting async support:
  function.length == 0 => sync, set this = context
  function.length == 1 => async, pass context, done() must be called
Pluggable mocking support
Better tests for not calling done
Unit test existing code
Configurable hook timeouts
Proper commandline runner
Allow forcing colour on/off (detect support?)
Update documentation
v0.1
Implement documentation style formatter (including base formatter class)
Helpers - needed given that we have closures?
